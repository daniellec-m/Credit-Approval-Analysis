# Credit-Approval-Analysis
In order to provide loans to customers, a bank needs to determine who
should be approved and who should not. This dataset is the German Credit Data that contains
20 attributes and the class attribute showing a good or a bad credit risk. This analysis helps bank managers in
loan approval decision making for prospective applicants/customers.
